0x1A. C - Hash tables
A hash function is a mathematical function that takes an input (or 'message') and returns a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hash value or hash code. The output is often a digest that appears random and unique, even for small changes in the input. Hash functions are commonly used in computer science for various purposes, including data retrieval, data integrity verification, and cryptography.
