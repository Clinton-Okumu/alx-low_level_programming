0x0F. C - Function pointers

Short description of function pointers in C:

Function pointers in C are variables that can store the address of a function. This means that a function pointer can be used to call a function indirectly.

Function pointers are a powerful tool that can be used to write more flexible and efficient C code. They can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:

Passing functions as arguments to other functions
Implementing callbacks
Implementing event-driven programming
